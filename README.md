This is the official implementation of "QuantV2X: A Fully Quantized Multi-Agent System for Cooperative Perception". In this work, we address the problems of inefficiency and performance degradation for cooperative perception in real-world resource-constrained scenarios. We illustrate the system-level latency bottleneck in full-precision systems and introduce QuantV2X, a fully quantized multi-agent system for cooperative perception that enables efficient model inference and multi-agent communication with maximum perception performance preservation while meeting the requirements of real-world deployment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the f irst work to demonstrate the viability and practicality of a fully quantized intermediate fusion system for future real-world deployment.

This work is part of our broader vision of building an __efficient and scalable V2X ecosystem__, comprising data-efficient pretraining with [CooPre](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11241), training-efficient multi-agent learning with [TurboTrain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04682), and inference-efficient cooperative perception with [QuantV2X](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03704).

## Release Plan
- **`2025/10`**: Codebase Release with V2X-Real dataset support and TensorRT support.
- **`2025/09`**: [QuantV2X](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03704) paper release.

## Acknowledgement
