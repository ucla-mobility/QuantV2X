This is the official implementation of "QuantV2X: A Fully Quantized Multi-Agent System for Cooperative Perception". In this work, we address the problems of inefficiency and performance degradation for cooperative perception in real-world resource-constrained scenarios. We illustrate the system-level latency bottleneck in full-precision systems and introduce QuantV2X, a fully quantized multi-agent system for cooperative perception that enables efficient model inference and multi-agent communication with maximum perception performance preservation while meeting the requirements of real-world deployment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the viability and practicality of a fully quantized intermediate fusion system for future real-world deployment.

This work is part of our broader vision of building an __efficient and scalable V2X ecosystem__, comprising data-efficient pretraining with [CooPre](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11241), training-efficient multi-agent learning with [TurboTrain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04682), and inference-efficient cooperative perception with [QuantV2X](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03704).

## Installation

### Step 1: Basic Installation

```bash
conda create -n quantv2x python=3.8 pytorch==1.12.0 torchvision==0.13.0 torchaudio==0.12.0 cudatoolkit=11.6 -c pytorch -c conda-forge
conda activate quantv2x
# install dependency
pip install -r requirements.txt
# install this project. It's OK if EasyInstallDeprecationWarning shows up.
python setup.py develop
```

### Step 2: Install Spconv 2.x

To install **spconv 2.x**, check the [table](https://github.com/traveller59/spconv#spconv-spatially-sparse-convolution-library) to run the installation command. For example we have cudatoolkit 11.6, then we should run

```bash
pip install spconv-cu116 # match your cudatoolkit version
```

### Step 3: Bbx IoU cuda version compile

Install bbx nms calculation cuda version

```bash
python opencood/utils/setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
